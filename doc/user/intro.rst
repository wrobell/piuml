piUML is designed and implemented around following ideas

#. Models should be simple, robust and easy to understand. They are
   created to help us understand how a system works.
#. Models are general represention of reality. Model containing every
   detail of a system is its copy, which defeats purpose of modeling.
#. Every aspect of a model shall be visible on its diagram. Hiding parts of
   a model into configuration files, preferences and properties dialog boxes
   makes it hard or impossible to understand.
